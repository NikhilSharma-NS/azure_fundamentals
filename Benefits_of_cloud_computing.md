1) Benefits fo cloud Computing

Cost savings - both real and accounting
Agility 
Avaliability
Security
Global reach
Range of raady on-demand services
Range of tools
Scalability

1.1) Cost Savings

Economies of scale
Total cost of ownership(TCO) - electricity,internet,cooling,employees
Microsoft can run a server cheaper than anone else with few exceptions
4 vCPU server as low as $187/mon

- we can take actions to reduce our cost - i.e. autoscaling
- it's not possible for most businesses to run data centers in multiple countries

1.2) High Avaliability

- Expressed as a percentage,it's the ability of a system to respond to users
- 99.99 % ( 4 minute per month down time)

1.3) Scalability
- The ability of a system to handle growth of users or work
-

1.4) Elasticity
- The ability of a system to automatically grow and shrink based on application demand

1.5) Agility 
- The ability to change rapidly based on changes to market or environment

1.6) Disaster Recovery
- The ability of a system to recover from failure within a period of time and how much data is lost

2) Captital Expenditure(CapEx) and Operational Expenditure(OpEx)
- Capx is money invested in assests (like computers) that return investment over time
- OpEx is money spent every day on opearting expenses

3) Consumption-Based Model
