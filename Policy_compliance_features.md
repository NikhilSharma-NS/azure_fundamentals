#### NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)

- National Institute of Standard and Technology (NIST)
- Audited for compliance to security and privacy processes

#### Azure Sovereign regions

- Seprate account to access other regions
- For US government agencies - federal,state and local
- Department of Defense(DoD) has its own too
- Isolagted data centers separate from the Azure public cloud
- Meets standards specific to government
- We were creating the policies and the blueprints that there was a 
 FedRAMP,NIST 800.171.(DIB),ITAR,IRS 1075,DoD L4 and CJIS
- for that portal.azure.us 
- Different Urls for connecting to storage , functions etc
- Azure China runs as an independent company as well 
- seprate account , Data remains in China
- Now there used to be seprate region for Germany but now all of Europe Follows
- those standards in terms of data protection so thet don't even consider germany a seprate a sovereign region anymore
